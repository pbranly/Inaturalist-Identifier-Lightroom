 Script : file_helpers.lua
 Purpose : Utility module for managing JPEG files in a directory
 Author  : Philippe (or your name here)
 Description :
 This module provides helper functions used by the Lightroom plugin to:
   1. Delete all JPEG files (*.jpg) from a specified directory. This ensures that
      old or temporary exports don't accumulate between plugin runs.
   2. Find and return the first JPEG file in a directory. This is useful after a 
      photo is exported and needs to be located for further processing.

 These functions support the pluginâ€™s workflow, especially when preparing and managing
 temporary image files during the species identification process.

 Dependencies:
 - Logger.lua: For logging deletion actions and file detections.
 - Lightroom SDK: LrFileUtils and LrPathUtils for filesystem and path operations.

-- Import Lightroom utilities for file and path handling
local LrFileUtils = import "LrFileUtils"     -- For file operations (delete, list files, etc.)
local LrPathUtils = import "LrPathUtils"     -- For working with file extensions, paths, etc.

-- Import custom logger
local logger = require("Logger")             -- Custom logging module for tracking actions

-- Deletes all JPEG (.jpg) files in the given directory
-- This function scans the target directory and deletes every file with a .jpg extension
local function clearJPEGs(directory)
    for file in LrFileUtils.files(directory) do
        -- Check if file has ".jpg" extension (case-insensitive)
        if string.lower(LrPathUtils.extension(file)) == "jpg" then
            LrFileUtils.delete(file)  -- Delete the file
            logger.logMessage(LOC("$$$/iNat/Log/JPGDeleted=JPG file deleted: ") .. file)
        end
    end
end

-- Returns the first JPEG file found in the directory
-- Used to retrieve the image file that was just exported
local function findSingleJPEG(directory)
    for file in LrFileUtils.files(directory) do
        -- Return the first file with a .jpg extension (case-insensitive)
        if string.lower(LrPathUtils.extension(file)) == "jpg" then
            return file
        end
    end
    return nil  -- No JPG file found
end

-- Export functions for use in other modules
return {
    clearJPEGs = clearJPEGs,           -- Function to delete all JPEGs in a folder
    findSingleJPEG = findSingleJPEG    -- Function to return the first found JPEG
